title: Useful Commands for Text Manipulation
---

Long story short: I have used Windows for a long time in my career, since I was primarily using
Microsoft technologies. And it was a nice period with beautiful windows helping
me to complete my tasks. Until I try a *nix environment full-time and figure
out the terminal powerful.

Yes, I know. Windows has the Command Prompt, but it is not the same thing.
Windows was created to democratize the access of a personal computer in the easiest
way. While one of the Unix philosophy is to create programs that do only one thing
(and do that only one thing very well).

It may seem awkward to use these tools in the beginning, however afterwards you can realize a boost in your productivity.

In this article, I want to show some useful commands for text manipulation
tasks. Let's take a look.

* [cat](#cat) (concatenate files and print on the standard output)
* cut (cut out selected portions of each line of a file)
* awk (pattern-directed scanning and processing language)
* sed (stream editor)
* grep (file pattern searcher)
* sort (sort or merge records (lines) of text files)
* uniq (report or filter out repeated lines in a file)
* fmt (simple text formatter)
* tr (translate characters)
* nl (line numbering filter)
* wc (word, line, character, and byte count)

## cat
> concatenate files and print on the standard output

cat is one of the most basic commands. You can use to create, concatenate or
display the content of a file.

```shell
cat 

awk, sed, grep, sort, uniq, cat, cut, fmt, tr, nl, egrep, fgrep, wc
