title: About
---

I have over 7 years of experience developing software and I have worked at both startups and large organizations. While I’m on my way to becoming a proficient full-stack developer, my expertise is in building backend services, from API design until writing SQL queries.

I love the process to build and maintain valuable software. Although hard engineering problems are often fun to solve, I’m more attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.

I’m driven by working with collaborative teams and absorbing context about the business.
