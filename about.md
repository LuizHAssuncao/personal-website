title: About
---

I have been working as Software Engineer and I have experience at startups and large organizations. My expertise is building backend services, from designing APIs to writing SQL queries.

I love the process of building and maintaining valuable software. Even though hard engineering problems are often fun to solve, I'm more attracted to solve real customer problems with a business justification.

I'm driven by working with collaborative teams and I'm always interested to absorb context about the business.
